        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Racing Pro Members or RpM team dates back to August 8th of 2014 when 8 Korean friends decided to create a new skill-based Korean Asphalt team. They elected Kim Min-Sung aka RpM_Kimchi as the first leader and Chris Lee as the first co-leader of the team. ÏÑùÍ∞ÄÎ™®Îãà aka Buddha suggested the name of the team to be RpM. After the creation, Kimchi put all his efforts to help his teammates improve their skill by introducing RpM Battles, making tutorials, recording laps and making comparisons, etc. With time, RpM started to gain reputation and started dominating the leaderboards.

          Later on, with the support of his teammates, Kimchi decided to declare RpM as an international team in order to guarantee its survival. Rashid Hassan joined RpM as the first non-Korean member. With the entry of members from all over the world, the RpM name started growing and prospering along the years. Many talented members have helped the team to hold up to its reputation and to be recognized as one of the best skill-based Asphalt teams of all time.

          During a conversation with Kim, he was asked the following question,

      Based on your experience, what is the most important quality of a member: skill, behavior or loyalty?

  He answered,

      Behavior, without a doubt. Skills could be taught over time. When both are satisfied, loyalty will follow.

  He also added,

      A skillful and supportive environment is very important to guarantee a team's success. The more skilled members should support the less skilled ones, which will result in their own improvement just as well.

        <p>
          In December 2014, Kim left Asphalt 8 and the team. Before leaving, Kim appointed Kevin Hu aka RpM_Venom as the team leader. He was also the first non-Korean leader of the team. Since then, the amazing leaders and members of the team have been representing us on the leaderboards while also working on various projects for the betterment of the team. Without a doubt, Kim's efforts to build the team will forever be appreciated. But what we appreciate even more is the fact that he had given us more than just a team, he gave us a family.
